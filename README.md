## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I started using SCSS. I learned how to use variables and different files to organize my code. It was my first time using SCSS, and I really enjoyed it. Iâ€™ll definitely use it in my future projects.

### Continued development

Since it was my first time using SCSS, I think I need to practice more. I did a lot of reasearch to understand how to use it, and I think I need to practice more to get better at it.
